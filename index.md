## Postdoctoral Researcher

---

**Email:** [kvalheim@seas.upenn.edu][1]

Here is my **[CV](assets/Kvalheim_CV.pdf)**.



---

I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Kod*Lab][12] at the [University of Pennsylvania][9]. Starting in August 2022 I will be a postdoctoral Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics][19] at the [University of Michigan][3]. 
My **[research](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~kvalheim/research/)** interests are nonlinear systems in general, and in particular dynamics and control, geometry and topology, and stochastic processes.

## Some recent presentation materials:

* [Slides](/~kvalheim/assets/cornell-2-21-2022.pdf) from a talk at the Cornell [Probability Seminar][14]. **Topic**: "flux" in small-noise dynamical systems. 
* ([Video][18], [slides](/~kvalheim/assets/umich-2-4-2022.pdf)) from a talk at the U Michigan [Control Seminar][15]. **Topic**: topological approaches to the stabilizability/safety problems in control theory.
* [Video][16] from a talk at the Rutgers [TRIPODS/DATA-INSPIRE institute][17]. **Topic**: Conley's fundamental theorem for "hybrid" dynamical systems.
