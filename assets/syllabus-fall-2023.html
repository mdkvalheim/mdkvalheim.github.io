<font size=4><b>Course Description</b></font>
<hr>
Linear algebra is ubiquitous in disciplines scientific and social and is a thriving discipline on its own with branches in <a href=http://www.siam.org/journals/simax.php>applied</a> science and more theoretical analysis. In this course we will begin with systems of linear equations and their solutions and then start to abstract these techniques and create a general system of vector spaces from which more general manipulations are possible.  We will ground the theory in many examples.<p>

Objectives<br>
<ul>
<li>Competence in basic manipulations of matrices and vectors (e.g., ability to solve low-dimensional systems by hand, understand and implement a general row reduction algorithm to solve a linear system, calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors, construct orthogonal bases and projections, diagonalize matrices)
<li>Grasp of basic theory including existence of solutions, linear independence of vectors, determinants and matrix invertibility, nullspaces, column spaces and the rank theorem, characteristic equations and eigenvalues, eigenvectors and bases, geometry of orthogonal projections.
</ul>
 
<hr>
<font size=4><b>Grading Policy</b></font>
<hr>
Your grade will be broken down as 45% for three in-class exams (15% each), 30% for the final exam, and 25% for homework.  There will be approximately 11 weekly assignments, 2 of which may be dropped.  Since you may drop up to 2 homework assignments, I will not be allowing any late homework.  You are still responsible for the material on the homework even if it is not turned in.  You must clear a missed exam (allowed only for exigent circumstances)  with me prior to the test day.  In the case of an emergency, you must be able to provide verification (e.g., a doctor's note).<p>
Letter grades follow the traditional scale (90's are A's, 80's are B's, etc.)  Participation will be to a student's benefit.  Blackboard will be used to post grades.
<hr>
<font size=4><b>Academic Integrity Statement</b></font>
<hr>
<em>By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC's scholarly community in which everyone's academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal. To read the full Student Academic Conduct Policy, consult the UMBC Student Handbook, the Faculty Handbook, the UMBC Integrity webpage <a href=https://academicconduct.umbc.edu/>https://academicconduct.umbc.edu/</a> </em>.

<font size=4><b>Computational Component</b></font>
<hr>
We will use MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) for some homework problems this semester  You may find MATLAB in one of the campus computer <a href=https://wiki.umbc.edu/display/faq/Computer+Labs/>labs</a>.  You may also choose to purchase a student version from <a href=http://www.mathworks.com>MathWorks</a> if you do not already have a copy. 
-->
<hr>
<!--<font size=4><b>Diagnostic Quiz</b></font>
<hr>
You are assigned to take a Diagnostic Quiz posted <a href="diagnostic.pdf">here</a>.  This quiz will not be graded except for having been handed in.  This will let me and you know if you are at the bare minimum ready to take Math 221.
<hr>
<font size=4><b>Previous Course Summary and Final Exam</b></font>
<hr>
You may find a copy of the summary of the Math 221 course I previously taught <a href="Course_summary2008.pdf">here</a> and a copy of the previous final exam <a href="final2008.pdf">here</a>.  These are both to prepare you for the content and style of exams I offer as well as make you aware of the massive amount of vocabulary, content, and theory involved in this course up front.

<font size=4><b>Accessibility and Disability Accommodations, Guidance and Resources</b></font>
<hr>

Accommodations for students with disabilities are provided for all students with a qualified disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA & ADAAA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act who request and are eligible for accommodations. The Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) is the UMBC department designated to coordinate accommodations that creates equal access for students when barriers to participation exist in University courses, programs, or activities.<br><br>

If you have a documented disability and need to request academic accommodations in your courses, please refer to the SDS website at sds.umbc.edu for registration information and office procedures.<br><br>


SDS email: disability@umbc.edu<br><br>


SDS phone: 410-455-2459<br><br>


If you will be using SDS approved accommodations in this class, please contact the instructor to discuss implementation of the accommodations. During remote instruction requirements due to COVID, communication and flexibility will be essential for success.<p>

<font size=4><b>Sexual Assault, Sexual Harassment, and Gender Based Violence and Discrimination</b></font>
<hr>
<a href=https://ecr.umbc.edu/gender-discrimination-sexual-misconduct/>UMBC Policy</a> in addition to federal and state law (to include Title IX) prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in University programs and activities. Any student who is impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual exploitation, gender discrimination, pregnancy discrimination, gender-based harassment, or related retaliation should contact the University’s Title IX Coordinator to make a report and/or access support and resources. The Title IX Coordinator can be reached at titleixcoordinator@umbc.edu or 410-455-1717.<br><br>

You can access support and resources even if you do not want to take any further action. You will not be forced to file a formal complaint or police report. Please be aware that the University may take action on its own if essential to protect the safety of the community.<br><br>

If you are interested in making a report, please use the <a href=https://umbc-advocate.symplicity.com/titleix_report/index.php/pid364290?>Online Reporting/Referral Form</a>.  Please note that, if you report anonymously, the University’s ability to respond will be limited.<br><br>

<font size=3><b>Notice that Faculty and Teaching Assistants are Responsible Employees with Mandatory Reporting Obligations </b></font><br><br>

All faculty members and teaching assistants are considered Responsible Employees, per UMBC’s <a href=https://ecr.umbc.edu/policy-on-sexual-misconduct-sexual-harassment-and-gender-discrimination/>Policy on Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Harassment, and Gender Discrimination</a>. Faculty and teaching assistants therefore required to report all known information regarding alleged conduct that may be a violation of the Policy to the Title IX Coordinator, even if a student discloses an experience that occurred before attending UMBC and/or an incident that only involves people not affiliated with UMBC.  Reports are required regardless of the amount of detail provided and even in instances where support has already been offered or received.<br><br>

While faculty members want to encourage you to share information related to your life experiences through discussion and written work, students should understand that faculty are required to report past and present sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, stalking, and gender discrimination that is shared with them to the Title IX Coordinator so that the University can inform students of their  <a href=https://ecr.umbc.edu/rights-and-resources/>rights, resources, and support</a>.  While you are encouraged to do so, you are not obligated to respond to outreach conducted as a result of a report to the Title IX Coordinator.<br><br>
